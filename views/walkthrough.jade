    h2 Introduction
    p 
      | This document will walk you through creating a basic Tumblr theme.
      | While knowledge of HTML and CSS are required, the familiar framework
      | of a blog is a great place for new developers to start.
    
  section
    h2 Layout
    p 
      | CSS layouts can be challenging. 
      | For this theme, we're going to keep it simple. We'll start small and build from there, 
      | but when you want to dig deeper, these CSS frameworks can offer a lot of power.

    table
      tr
        th Framework
        th Description
      tr
        td 
          a(href="http://getskeleton.com/") Skeleton
        td 
          | Skeleton is a small collection of CSS &amp; JS files that can help you 
          | rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" 
          | laptop screen or an iPhone.
      tr
        td 
          a(href="http://html5boilerplate.com/") HTML5 Boilerplate
        td 
          | HTML5 Boilerplate is the professional badass's 
          | base HTML/CSS/JS template for a fast, robust and future-proof site.
      tr
        td 
          a(href="http://960.gs/") 960 Grid System
        td 
          | The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow 
          | by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. 
          | There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately or in tandem.
      tr
        td 
          a(href="http://blueprintcss.org/") Blueprint CSS
        td 
          | Blueprint is a CSS framework, which aims to cut down on your development time. 
          | It gives you a solid foundation to build your project on top of, with an 
          | easy-to-use grid, sensible typography, useful plugins, and even a stylesheet for printing.

    p This is our simple initial HTML5 markup.

    pre
      <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <html>

        <head>
          <title></title>
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>

      </html>

  section
    h2 Describing Posts in HTML
    p
     | The latest HTML5 tags are a perfect match for the semantic markup of a blog.
     | Semantic markup means that the HTML tags used describe the content it contains.
    p
     | We'll use an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag for each post and use CSS classes to specify the type
     | of post it is. Tumblr has seven different types of posts as well as sets of photos and answer posts.

    pre
      <article class="text"></article>
      <article class="photo"></article>
      <article class="photoset"></article>
      <article class="quote"></article>
      <article class="link"></article>
      <article class="chat"></article>
      <article class="audio"></article>
      <article class="video"></article>
      <article class="answer"></article>

    p
      | Before we can use this new HTML5 tag, we need to do a little extra work on our page.
      | We'll add a script that makes HTML5 tags work in older versions of IE. Not a big deal.
      | If a visitor's browser doesn't need it, the file won't be included.

    pre
      <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <html>

        <head>
          <title></title>
          <!-- This JavaScript file will make older versions of IE recognize new HTML5 tags. -->
          <!--[if lt IE 9]>
            <script src="//html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
          <![endif]-->
        </head>

        <body>
        </body>

      </html>

    p 
      | Let's add an element to hold our posts and give it an id value of <code>posts</code>.
      | We can use this id to uniquely identify this element in CSS and JavaScript if needed.
      | We'll add the <code>article</code> tags to this post.

    pre
      <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <html>

        <head>
          <title></title>
          <!-- This JavaScript file will make older versions of IE recognize new HTML5 tags. -->
          <!--[if lt IE 9]>
            <script src="//html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js"></script>
          <![endif]-->
        </head>

        <body>
          <!-- This element holds all of our posts. There is only one of them. -->
          <div id="posts">
            <article class="text"></article>
            <article class="photo"></article>
            <article class="photoset"></article>
            <article class="quote"></article>
            <article class="link"></article>
            <article class="chat"></article>
            <article class="audio"></article>
            <article class="video"></article>
            <article class="answer"></article>
          </div>
        </body>

      </html>

    p
      | You may have noticed that we used a <code>class</code> attribute, <code>class="photo"</code> to 
      | define what type of post the <code>article</code> tag contains.
      | An alternative would have been to use an <code>id</code>, but we will likely have
      | many posts of each type. An <code>id</code> is intended for use only when the element is unique.

    p We want to simulate each type of post so that we can style them. Let's take each on individually.

    p 
      | We are going to start looking at the 
      | <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes">Tumblr theme documentation</a>
      | It can feel a little daunting,
      | but at this point we'll just use it to inform our mark up for sample posts we'll create.

    section
      h3 Text
      p 
        | Text posts are made up of an optional title and a body.
        | The body can contain HTML, so this may be an area that could use some targeted CSS styling.
        | <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#text-posts">More in the docs.</a>
      pre
        <!-- 
          Post Type: Text
          {block:Title}{/block:Title}
          {Title}: Post Title
          {Body}: 
        -->
        <article class="text">
          <h2>Post Title</h2>
          <p>
            This is a sample post.
          </p>
        </article>
        p
          | Let's take this party over to JSFiddle for some styling...

    section
      h3 Photo
      p 
        | Photo posts can potentially have quite a bit of information, but the basics are
        | a photo and a caption.
        | <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes#photo-posts">More in the docs.</a>
      pre
        <!-- 
          Post Type: Photo
        -->
        <article class="text">
          <h2>Post Title</h2>
          <p>
            This is a sample post.
          </p>
